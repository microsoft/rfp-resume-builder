It is critical that you don't add/change/remove anything. You must only extract the information that is already present in the resume verbatim in all cases.

#Formatting Guidance#

Output valid json with the following fields: 

1. 'analysis' - this is the only output you will make that isn't in the resume content. It should be a brief analysis of the resume structure. Take note on where you see work experience and "Prior to CDM" experience.
1. 'name': The name of the candidate.
2. 'title': The title/role of the candidate.
3. 'work_experience': A list of projects. Needs to capture only the projects worked on at CDM Smith, nothing under the "Prior to CDM Smith" section.

#Example#
{
  "analysis": "The resume has a clear structure with a work experience section that lists projects worked on at CDM Smith and a section for prior to CDM Smith.",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "title": "Senior Engineer",
  "work_experience": [

    2. 'start_phrase': The substring to split on

    We will be inserting a new project BEFORE this substring. So think about what substring you would need to identify in order to insert the new project in the right place.
